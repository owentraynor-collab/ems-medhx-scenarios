# Systemic Red Flags in Emergency Medical Assessment

## Definition and Importance
Red flags are warning signs that suggest potentially serious underlying conditions requiring urgent medical attention. They serve three critical functions:
1. Early recognition of life-threatening conditions
2. Reduction of morbidity and mortality through prompt intervention
3. Appropriate resource allocation and hospital preparation

## Neurological Red Flags

### Headache
1. **Thunderclap Headache**
   - Clinical Significance: Subarachnoid hemorrhage
   - Action: Initiate stroke alert, rapid transport

2. **Headache with Neurological Deficits**
   - Clinical Significance: Stroke or mass lesion
   - Action: Notify receiving facility, document deficits

3. **Fever with Neck Stiffness**
   - Clinical Significance: Meningitis
   - Action: Infection precautions, urgent transport

4. **Post-Traumatic Headache**
   - Clinical Significance: Subdural or epidural hematoma
   - Action: Maintain c-spine precautions, rapid assessment

## Cardiovascular Red Flags

### Chest Pain
1. **Crushing Pain with Radiation**
   - Clinical Significance: STEMI
   - Action: 12-lead ECG, aspirin, rapid transport

2. **Tearing Pain to Back**
   - Clinical Significance: Aortic dissection
   - Action: Consider transport to tertiary care center

3. **Hypotension/Syncope with Chest Pain**
   - Clinical Significance: Consider PE, MI, aortic dissection
   - Action: Notify hospital, manage shock, prioritize transport

4. **Exertional Pain**
   - Clinical Significance: Angina/myocardial ischemia
   - Action: Monitor closely, obtain 12-lead, prepare for ACS protocols

## Respiratory Red Flags

1. **SpO2 < 90%**
   - Action: Immediate oxygen therapy

2. **Stridor/Gurgling**
   - Action: Position airway, consider advanced management

3. **Unequal Breath Sounds**
   - Action: Consider pneumothorax, monitor closely

## Abdominal Red Flags

1. **Rigid Abdomen/Rebound**
   - Clinical Significance: Peritonitis
   - Action: Surgical emergency, rapid transport

2. **GI Bleeding**
   - Clinical Significance: Hypovolemic shock risk
   - Action: Large-bore IV access, fluid resuscitation

3. **Pulsatile Mass + Pain**
   - Clinical Significance: Suspect AAA
   - Action: Gentle handling, rapid transport

4. **Persistent Vomiting**
   - Clinical Significance: Possible obstruction
   - Action: IV fluids, antiemetics, monitor electrolytes

## Musculoskeletal Red Flags

### Low Back Pain
1. **Cancer History + Weight Loss**
   - Clinical Significance: Spinal infection or malignancy
   - Action: Document findings, notify receiving facility

2. **Progressive Neurological Deficit**
   - Clinical Significance: Possible cauda equina syndrome
   - Action: Urgent recognition & transport

### Neck Pain
1. **High-Energy Trauma**
   - Clinical Significance: Cervical spine injury
   - Action: Maintain immobilization

2. **Neurological Symptoms**
   - Clinical Significance: Cord compression
   - Action: Document deficits, neurological assessment

## Altered Mental Status Red Flags

1. **Toxidrome Suspicion**
   - Signs: Overdose, pill bottles, drug paraphernalia
   - Action: Poison/toxicology protocols, consider Naloxone

2. **Glucose Abnormalities**
   - Action: Immediate correction of hypo/hyperglycemia

3. **Head Trauma/Anticoagulation**
   - Clinical Significance: Intracranial hemorrhage risk
   - Action: Rapid transport, hospital notification

4. **Focal Neurologic Deficits**
   - Clinical Significance: Stroke/hemorrhage
   - Action: Activate stroke alert

## Syncope Red Flags

1. **Exertional/No Prodrome**
   - Clinical Significance: Cardiac cause likely
   - Action: Priority cardiac center transport

2. **Associated Chest Pain**
   - Clinical Significance: Cardiac ischemia
   - Action: 12-lead ECG, monitoring

3. **Pregnancy-Related**
   - Clinical Significance: Ectopic/obstetric emergency
   - Action: OB facility notification

## Emergency Action Principles

1. Document red flags early in assessment
2. Communicate findings clearly to receiving facility
3. Prioritize rapid transport for time-sensitive conditions
4. Trust your assessment skills and clinical judgment

## Key Clinical Approach Takeaways

1. **Chest Pain & Headache**
   - Often require STEMI or stroke alerts
   - Rapid recognition and team activation

2. **Back & Neck Pain**
   - Focus on recognition & documentation
   - Immobilize when indicated

3. **Abdominal Pain**
   - Watch for surgical emergencies
   - Supportive care & transport

4. **Altered Mental Status**
   - Systematic approach due to broad differential
   - Check glucose early

5. **Syncope**
   - Consider cardiac, neurologic, or hemodynamic causes
   - Close monitoring and rapid transport

Remember: Early recognition of red flags saves lives and improves patient outcomes.`,
