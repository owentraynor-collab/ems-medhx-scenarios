# Red Flags in Emergency Medicine

## Definition
Red flags are critical clinical indicators that help EMS providers identify potentially serious conditions requiring urgent attention. They include:

- Warning signs that suggest a potentially serious underlying condition requiring urgent medical attention
- Clinical indicators that differentiate emergent from non-emergent presentations
- Critical findings that may not be immediately obvious but signal increased patient risk

## Importance in Emergency Medicine

Red flags serve several crucial functions in emergency care:

1. Early recognition of life-threatening conditions
2. Reduction of morbidity and mortality through prompt intervention
3. Appropriate resource allocation and hospital preparation

## How They Guide Paramedic Decision-Making

Red flags directly influence paramedic actions by helping to:

1. Determine transport priority and destination selection
2. Guide field interventions and treatment protocols
3. Inform hospital notifications (stroke alerts, STEMI activation)
4. Focus assessment and documentation on critical findings

## Clinical Example: Thunderclap Headache

### Case Presentation
- Red Flag: "Worst headache of life" with sudden onset
- Clinical Significance: Potential subarachnoid hemorrhage

### Paramedic Actions Required:
1. Initiate stroke alert protocol
2. Rapid transport to stroke center
3. Document time of onset and symptoms

## Key Principles

1. Red flags should trigger immediate clinical action
2. They help prioritize assessment findings
3. Documentation should clearly highlight identified red flags
4. Communication with receiving facilities should emphasize red flags
5. Red flags guide both immediate care and hospital preparation
