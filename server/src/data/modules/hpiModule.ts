# History of the Present Illness: OPQRST-ASPN Framework

## O - Onset
### Example Questions
- What were you doing at the time?
- Sudden or gradual?

### Clinical Pearls
- Establishing onset clarifies acuity
- Sudden onset (e.g., chest pain during exertion) suggests time-critical conditions (MI, stroke, PE)
- Gradual onset may indicate infection or chronic illness
- Sudden onset pain (especially chest, abdominal, or neuro symptoms) is often frequently more serious than gradual onset. Think AAA, MI, PE, or CVA.

## P - Provocation/Palliation
### Example Questions
- What makes it worse?
- What makes it better?
- Effect of rest, activity, or position?

### Clinical Pearls
- Helps identify mechanical vs. physiologic causes
- Pain that worsens with exercise but improves at rest may suggest cardiac ischemia
- Positional changes may suggest musculoskeletal
- Relief with sitting forward = pericarditis, relief with lying = not always cardiac, can also be esophageal spasm

## Q - Quality
### Example Questions
- How would you describe it?
- Sharp, dull, burning, throbbing

### Clinical Pearls
- Symptom descriptors guide differentiation: crushing/cardiac, burning = GERD/MI, tearing = aortic dissection
- Capturing the patient's own words avoids bias

## R - Region/Radiation
### Example Questions
- Where exactly is it—Can you point with one finger?
- Does it travel anywhere?

### Clinical Pearls
- Radiation pain helps determine the affected system
- Radiation patterns are classic diagnostic clues (e.g., chest pain radiating to left arm = cardiac, flank pain radiating to groin = renal colic, epigastric pain radiating to back = AAA or pancreatitis)

## S - Severity
### Example Questions
- 0-10 now? Worst/best?
- How does it limit work/exercise/sleep?

### Clinical Pearls
- Establishes a baseline for monitoring
- Guides urgency and treatment effectiveness
- Helps distinguish between minor discomfort and potentially life-threatening pain
- High-severity pain out of proportion to physical findings (e.g., minimal tenderness but severe pain) = think ischemia (mesenteric, limb, cardiac)

## T - Timing
### Example Questions
- When did this start?
- Constant or intermittent?
- How long does it last if intermittent?
- Trend since onset?

### Clinical Pearls
- Elicits duration and evolution
- Constant, unrelenting pain often signals serious pathology
- Intermittent pain may be colicky (e.g., gallstones, kidney stones)
- New onset of pain is often more concerning than a chronic pain that patient knows well

## AS - Associated Symptoms
### Example Questions
- Are other symptoms commonly present with this complaint present?
- Are any common red flags present?

### Clinical Pearls
- Look for primary complaint vs systemic involvement
- For example, chest pain + diaphoresis + SOB raises suspicion for ACS
- Headache + neuro deficits suggests stroke
- Abdominal pain + syncope suggests ruptured AAA
