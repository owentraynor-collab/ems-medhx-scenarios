    text: "Which onset pattern is more concerning for a potential cardiac event?",
    options: [
      "Gradual onset over several days",
      "Sudden onset during exertion",
      "Intermittent pain that comes and goes",
      "Pain that develops after eating"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Sudden onset during exertion",
    explanation: "Sudden onset, especially during exertion, is a classic presentation for cardiac events like MI. This pattern suggests time-critical conditions that require immediate evaluation.",
    difficulty: "basic"
  },
  {
    text: "A patient with chest pain reports relief when sitting forward. What condition should you consider?",
    options: [
      "Myocardial infarction",
      "Pericarditis",
      "Pneumonia",
      "Gastric reflux"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Pericarditis",
    explanation: "Relief of chest pain when sitting forward is a classic sign of pericarditis. This positional relief is due to decreased friction between the inflamed pericardial layers.",
    difficulty: "intermediate"
  },
  {
    text: "When assessing pain radiation, what does chest pain radiating to the left arm typically suggest?",
    options: [
      "Musculoskeletal injury",
      "Cardiac origin",
      "Pneumonia",
      "Anxiety"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Cardiac origin",
    explanation: "Chest pain radiating to the left arm is a classic radiation pattern for cardiac ischemia. This pattern is one of the key diagnostic clues for identifying potential cardiac events.",
    difficulty: "basic"
  },
  {
    text: "What is the clinical significance of pain that is severe but has minimal physical findings on examination?",
    options: [
      "Patient is likely exaggerating",
      "Consider potential ischemia",
      "Probably musculoskeletal",
      "Indicates chronic condition"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Consider potential ischemia",
    explanation: "High-severity pain out of proportion to physical findings should raise suspicion for ischemic conditions, such as mesenteric ischemia, limb ischemia, or cardiac ischemia.",
    difficulty: "advanced"
  },
  {
    text: "Which combination of associated symptoms with chest pain increases concern for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)?",
    options: [
      "Cough and fever",
      "Diaphoresis and shortness of breath",
      "Dizziness and nausea only",
      "Muscle soreness and fatigue"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Diaphoresis and shortness of breath",
    explanation: "The combination of chest pain with diaphoresis (sweating) and SOB (shortness of breath) significantly raises the suspicion for ACS and requires immediate evaluation.",
    difficulty: "intermediate"
  },
  {
    text: "What is the clinical significance of intermittent, colicky pain?",
    options: [
      "Always indicates a benign condition",
      "May suggest gallstones or kidney stones",
      "Definitely requires surgery",
      "Indicates cardiac condition"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "May suggest gallstones or kidney stones",
    explanation: "Intermittent, colicky pain is often associated with obstruction, such as gallstones or kidney stones. This pattern helps differentiate from other causes of pain.",
    difficulty: "intermediate"
  },
  {
    text: "A patient with abdominal pain reports a recent syncopal episode. What serious condition should you consider?",
    options: [
      "Food poisoning",
      "Ruptured AAA",
      "Gastritis",
      "Appendicitis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Ruptured AAA",
    explanation: "The combination of abdominal pain and syncope should raise immediate concern for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which is a life-threatening emergency.",
    difficulty: "advanced"
  },
  {
    text: "When documenting pain quality, why is it important to use the patient's own words?",
    options: [
      "It makes the documentation longer",
      "It avoids bias in interpretation",
      "It's required by protocol",
      "It saves time"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "It avoids bias in interpretation",
    explanation: "Using the patient's own words to describe pain quality helps avoid provider bias and ensures accurate documentation of the patient's experience, which can be crucial for diagnosis.",
    difficulty: "basic"
  }
