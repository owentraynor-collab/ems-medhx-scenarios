      "To determine billing codes",
      "To satisfy protocol requirements"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "To identify potentially serious conditions requiring urgent medical attention",
    explanation: "Red flags are warning signs that help identify potentially serious underlying conditions requiring urgent medical attention, enabling early intervention and appropriate resource allocation.",
    difficulty: "basic"

    text: "How do red flags impact hospital notification decisions?",
    options: [
      "They don't affect hospital notifications",
      "They trigger specific alerts like stroke or STEMI activation",
      "They only affect documentation",
      "They only determine transport time"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "They trigger specific alerts like stroke or STEMI activation",
    explanation: "Red flags guide hospital notification decisions, such as activating stroke alerts or STEMI protocols, allowing hospitals to prepare appropriate resources before patient arrival.",

      "Subarachnoid hemorrhage",
      "Sinus infection"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Subarachnoid hemorrhage",
    explanation: "A thunderclap headache, described as the 'worst headache of life' with sudden onset, is a red flag for potential subarachnoid hemorrhage, requiring immediate stroke center transport.",

    text: "How do red flags influence transport decisions?",
    options: [
      "They don't affect transport decisions",
      "They determine transport priority and destination selection",
      "They only affect documentation",
      "They only influence treatment protocols"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "They determine transport priority and destination selection",
    explanation: "Red flags help paramedics determine both transport priority (emergency vs. non-emergency) and appropriate destination selection (e.g., stroke center vs. general ED).",

    text: "What is a key characteristic of critical findings in red flags?",
    options: [
      "They are always obvious",
      "They may not be immediately obvious but signal increased patient risk",
      "They only appear in vital signs",
      "They are only relevant for documentation"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "They may not be immediately obvious but signal increased patient risk",
    explanation: "Critical findings, as part of red flags, may not be immediately obvious to providers but are important indicators of increased patient risk that require careful assessment.",
    difficulty: "advanced"

  {
    text: "How do red flags contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality?",
    options: [
      "Through better documentation",
      "Through prompt intervention based on early recognition",
      "By simplifying protocols",
      "By reducing transport times"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Through prompt intervention based on early recognition",
    explanation: "Red flags help reduce morbidity and mortality by enabling early recognition of life-threatening conditions and facilitating prompt, appropriate interventions.",
    difficulty: "intermediate"

    text: "What should be emphasized when communicating red flags to receiving facilities?",
    options: [
      "Patient demographics only",
      "Transport times only",
      "Critical findings and their clinical significance",
      "Insurance information"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Critical findings and their clinical significance",
    explanation: "When communicating with receiving facilities, paramedics should emphasize identified red flags and their clinical significance to ensure appropriate hospital preparation and response.",
    difficulty: "basic"
  },
  {
    text: "How should red flags influence documentation?",
    options: [
      "They should be mentioned only in the narrative",
      "They should be clearly highlighted throughout the documentation",
      "They don't need to be documented",
      "They only need to be verbally reported"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "They should be clearly highlighted throughout the documentation",
    explanation: "Red flags should be clearly highlighted in documentation to ensure proper communication of critical findings and support clinical decision-making throughout the patient care continuum.",
